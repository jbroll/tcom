I needed to be able to exchange data buffers with a COM interface.  If the 
tcl procedure is called with a byte array object a buffer of the corrosponding
size is passed to the COM routine.  On return the data from the buffer is 
copied back to the byte array.  There are a few too many byte array objects 
created and the data is copied too many times, but it works and isn't grossly 
inefficient and works for me.

Tcom is a Windows-specific Tcl extension that provides commands to access and
implement COM objects.  This extension enables client-side and server-side
scripting of COM objects through IDispatch and IUnknown derived interfaces.

INSTALLATION

This distribution includes compiled libraries that can be loaded by the binary
release of Tcl/Tk 8.2 or later for Windows.  Copy the contents of the lib
directory to the Tcl library directory.  For example, if the Tcl library
directory is C:\Tcl\lib, enter this command at the command prompt:

    xcopy lib C:\Tcl\lib /s


TCL ACTIVE SCRIPT ENGINE

This distribution includes an experimental implementation of a Tcl Active
Script engine.  It implements just enough of the IActiveScript and
IActiveScriptParse interfaces to enable Internet Explorer and Windows Script
Host to run simple scripts.  It works with the ActiveTcl binary distribution
from ActiveState.  To register the script engine (assuming the Tcl library
directory is C:\Tcl\lib), change the current working directory to
C:\Tcl\lib\TclScript and run the register.tcl script.
